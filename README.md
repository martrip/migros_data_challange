# migros_data_challange
**Task:**
<br/>As data scientists we were tasked with finding the best places to create new Migros stores in the city and surrounding of Zurich. We should analyze the market opportunities based on the density of existing stores, presence of competitors, and general population density to inform Migros’ development strategy.

**Findings:**
As a result we saw there are more potential Migros locations. Based on the pupulation density (layering) and the results from the Logistic Regression 
Potential area: City Centre close to the ETH (student area) and Universitäts Spital (one of the biggest hospitals of Switzerland) --> Student area & Hospital, but no Coop or Migros
